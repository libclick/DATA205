# DATA205
This project has 3 separate files for the python coding. Part 1 is the Data Ingestion and Wrangling, and Part 2 is the EDA, Visualizations, Statistical Analysis
and Final Product coding. The supplemental is a file also coded in Python but processed by attaching the csv lr_df into Google Colab in order to rebalance the
test/train dataset for logistical regression. Anaconda would not recognize the ibmlearn package in order to use SMOTE, but Google Colab allowed me to process this
part of the analysis. The final product is 3 maps that are saved to interactive html files.
I put the html files in index.md of this repository on the final run. The links are stored there and bring up my github webpage for this repository.
There is a powerpoint presentation explaining the data and analysis, as well as a word document report of the same.
